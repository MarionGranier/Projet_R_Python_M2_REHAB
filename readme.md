## Scientific problem
A stroke is an acquired brain injury that occurs due to the obstruction or hemorrhage of a blood vessel. It is the leading cause of acquired disability in France.
Depending on the location and extent of the affected area, the consequences of a stroke vary. One of the main consequences is motor impairment of the upper limb, known as paresis. 80% of hemiparetic individuals experience difficulties in performing daily life activities (Dusfour, 2023). According to Kleim and Jones (2008), motor recovery of the paretic upper limb is enhanced by its use, whereas if the arm is not used, functional abilities are lost: “Use it and improve it, or lose it.” After returning home, the goal is to use the paretic arm as much as possible. However, due to motor impairment, using the paretic arm requires increased effort and is often associated with failures and harmful compensatory movements. This leads to learned non-use of the arm (Taub et al., 2006).

### Aim:
The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the intra-individual variability of the FuncUseRatio, measured over one week in chronic-phase post-stroke patients, is significantly different over six consecutive months, based on accelerometric measurements in an ecological setting.

### Method:
Each participant wore an AX3 accelerometer (Axivity, Newcastle Helix, England, https://axivity.com/product/ax3) on each wrist at home for 7 days per month over six consecutive months. During these 7 days of accelerometer wear, participants were required to complete an activity journal, recording the start and end times of each activity performed. After each meal, they had to rate their fatigue using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The wristbands containing the accelerometers were not to be removed during the 7-day recording period.

### Participants:
5 hemiparetic patients in the chronic phase of stroke.

### Outcome measure:
Use: amount of arm movements 
FuncUse: amount of functional arm movements
(Func)UseRatio = (Func)Use of paretic UL / paretic and non-paretic (Func)Use x 100
Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity score /66
VAS fatigue score /100
